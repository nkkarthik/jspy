* spy

A simple java trace utility

** Usage

   Checkout into a directory (say /spy/).

*** Change =.spy.clj=

1. Change =:host= and =:port= to point to the remote debug session.
2. Set =:classes= to the base package of the classes to trace.
3. Optionally, change =exclude-classes= list to packages/classes you want to exclude from trace.

*** Start repl (in the shell): =spy$ bin/lein repl= 

    Note: If =bin/lein= is not executable then run: =chmod u+x bin/lein=

*** Start spy: =spy=> (spy)=
    
    This is assuming remote debug session is already started with jvm args ~-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=<port-number>~

*** Show trace (and stop spy): =spy=> (gui)=

*** Exit with =Ctrl-C=
